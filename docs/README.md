## Project Summary

This project focuses on enhancing virtual patient simulations used in dental education by introducing a custom case creation feature. The main objective is to provide tutors with a user-friendly portal that allows them to design unique clinical cases, enabling students to interact with a diverse range of dental scenarios. The system combines ReactJS for the frontend, Firebase for data management, and Unity for 3D modeling, creating a seamless experience for both tutors and students.

By automating the generation of 3D models based on case data, the system offers an interactive learning environment, improving critical skills such as history taking, diagnosis, and treatment planning. The project was evaluated through user testing involving both students and tutors, yielding positive feedback on usability and educational effectiveness. This innovation aims to bridge the gap in dental simulators by offering customizable and scalable solutions for teaching and learning complex dental scenarios.

## Methodology
The simulator is divided into two main sections:
- **Student View:** Allows dental students to assess virtual patients, covering stages such as history taking, examination, investigation, and diagnosis.
- **Tutor View:** Enables tutors to create cases by marking digital dental charts, defining questions, and automating 3D model customization based on patient data.

---

## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of:
- A web interface (ReactJS)
- Unity-based 3D simulation engine
- Firebase for database management and user authentication

---

## Evaluation
The system was tested with **10 students** and **8 tutors** from the Faculty of Dental Sciences, University of Peradeniya. The feedback collected through pre- and post-questionnaires highlighted significant improvements in both usability and educational effectiveness.

---

## Future Directions
- Integration of **haptic feedback** for enhanced realism.
- Expanding case libraries with **AI-assisted custom case creation**.
- Incorporating **VR technologies** for immersive learning experiences.

---

## Conclusion
This project presents a comprehensive approach to virtual patient simulations in dentistry, offering both customizability and automation. The tutor interface and case library ensure a dynamic and broad learning environment for students, while real-time feedback mechanisms help improve performance.
