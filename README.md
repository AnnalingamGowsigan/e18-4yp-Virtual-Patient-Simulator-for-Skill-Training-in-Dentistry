# Virtual patient simulator for skill training in dentistry
___
### Introduction
In modern dental education, Virtual Patient Simulators (VPS) have gained popularity due to limitations associated with traditional teaching methods. These limitations include tutor dependency, ethical dilemmas, and scenario constraints. However, existing patient simulators still face challenges such as high installation and maintenance costs, technological requirements, and a lack of effective feedback mechanisms.To address these issues, previous batches from the Computer Engineering Department of the University of Peradeniya have developed a web-based virtual patient simulator for skill training in dentistry. This simulator features an interactive 3D model, including extra-oral and intra-oral views, a dental room, and instrument selection. Despite its strengths, the system has limitations related to custom case creation and the integration of haptic feedback. Our project aims to enhance this existing virtual patient simulator by enabling tutors to create custom patient cases covering a wide range of clinical scenarios and integrating haptic sensations with the system. These advancements to the system will improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning outcomes for both tutors and students, providing a more realistic experience within the simulator.
